      <description>In August 2010, OpenSSH 5.6 added support for certificate authentication (release notes), unfortunately, no documentation really exists at the moment (you are on your own with sshd_config(1), ssh-keygen(1) and ssh_config(1), good luck with that). This is a surprising because this feature is awesome for system administrators, even for a small deployment.
Certificates allow you to sign user or host keys. In other words:
- Thanks to a unique file (CA certificate) on the server, it can accept any (signed) user keys transparently - If every servers&amp;rsquo; host keys are signed, clients only need to carry the CA to authenticate every servers of your network, which means no more &amp;ldquo;The authenticity of host foobar can&amp;rsquo;t be established.</description>
