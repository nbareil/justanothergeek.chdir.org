				<p>Sometimes, I receive emails asking me to translate my papers or blog
posts in English; each time, I procrastinate and never do it. My year&rsquo;s
resolution is to address this issue, that&rsquo;s why this blog goes english
now.<br />
<br />
Off course, I will not translate previous posts because it would be so
time-consumming that even just identify which post is interesting enough
to be translated would be too long.<br />
<br />
That&rsquo;s why I will keep available my previous posts at this address:
<a href="http://chdir.org/%7Enico/blog/posts/">http://chdir.org/~nico/blog/posts/</a>
and also because there are indexed by search engines.<br />
<br />
Â That is also the occasion of using a modern blogging engine like before
my switch to ikiwiki, so I use the Blogspot services from now on:<br />
-   Atom and RSS feeds are both redirected to the blogspot Atom feed
    (yeah that sucks for RSS-only reader)
-   <a href="http://chdir.org/%7Enico/blog/">http://chdir.org/~nico/blog/</a>
    redirects to
    <a href="http://justanothergeek.chdir.org/%20">justanothergeek.chdir.org</a></p>

<p>Now that comments are back, feel free to nitpick :)<br />
