<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I have nothing to do with the following, all credits go
to their respective authors. I&rsquo;m just publishing my 2011&rsquo;s bookmarks
about Linux kernel security with a one line summary based on my
(possibly wrong) understanding<br />
Do not hesitate to correct me (gently if possible :)) in comments or
mail.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=2522">False boundaries of (certain)
capabilities</a>:
Brad Spengler describes 19 capabilities (of 35) which can be used to
regain full privileges. Coincidentally, <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1105168/focus=1107204">Vasily Kulikov discovered a
“funny” behavior of
CAP_NET_ADMIN</a>
which permit to load any modules available in /lib/modules/ instead
of limiting to network related modules only, AFAIK, this
vulnerability was closed but the fix got reverted some weeks later
because of some userspace breakages.</li>
<li><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/461811/">PaX team introduced a new range of
stuff</a> using the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/457543/">new GCC plugin
infrastructure</a>. At compile-time,
pro-active code is automatically added to potentially dangerous
paths:

<ul>
<li><code>constify_plugin.c</code> enforces read-onlintroduces new constraints
(<code>__do_const</code> and <code>__no_const</code>) enforcing read-only permissions
at compilation-time and run-time. PaX then makes usage of theses
new constraints by patching most of the “ops structures”. The
plugin also automatically protects structures where all members
are function pointers, this patching on-the-fly is required
because patching directly the source kernel would never be
integrated upstream.</li>
<li><code>stackleak_plugin.c</code> adds instrumentation code before
<code>alloca()</code> calls. This code checks that stack-frame size does
not overlap with kernel task size. It circumvents techniques
described in <a href="http://cansecwest.com/core05/memory_vulns_delalleau.pdf">&ldquo;Large memory management vulnerabilities&rdquo; by Gaël
Delalleau</a>
(2005) and <a href="http://jon.oberheide.org/files/infiltrate12-thestackisback.pdf">&ldquo;The stack is back&rdquo; by Jon
Oberheide</a> (2012).</li>
<li>GCC 4.6 introduced <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Named-Address-Spaces.html">named address
spaces</a>.
It was initially specified for embedded processors but PaX team
uses this feature to represent user and kernel space.
<code>checker_plugin.c</code> thus introduces <code>__user</code>, <code>__kernel</code> and
<code>__iomem</code> namespaces to spot non-legit flows between
address spaces.</li>
<li><code>kallocstat_plugin.c</code> produces statistics about the size given
in parameter to various memory allocation functions</li>
<li><code>kernexec_plugin.c</code> enforces non-executable pages like the
<code>KERNEXEC</code> PaX feature, but without huge performance impact
on AMD64.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/13365">pagexec also managed to compile Linux Kernel with
clang</a>
by patching both Linux and clang. Now that gcc integrated plugins,
it is less interesting  but llvm was the solely compiler with easy
access to its internal structure, allowing external applications to
perform static analysis&hellip;</li>
<li>A <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cryptoapi/5304">user space interface to kernel Crypto-API was submitted to kernel
developers</a>,
an interesting use-case was to offer a way to deport key material
between processes. Imagine process A in possession of private keys
and another one, B, actually performing encryption / decryption
stuff part. The idea was to initialize a “crypto socket” in A and
pass this file descriptor to B (via a classic ancillary message).</li>
<li>Pseudo-files in <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/</code> have a different security model than
“normal” files because of its ephemeral nature: checks need to
happen during each system call and not at <code>open()</code> time because
permissions can change at anytime. <a href="http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/SuidBinariesAndProcInterface/">Halfdog
discovered</a>
(and <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1097206">Kees Cook reported it to
LKML</a>) that not
all files were protected accordingly. If a program opens
<code>/proc/self/auxv</code> and keeps this file descriptor opened. Then, even
after a <code>execve()</code> of a setuid binary, the file descriptor would
still be available, leaking information! Fixing this vulnerability
has been a long road and a pretty solution came up with the
introduction of <code>revoke()</code>, a new syscall invalidating
file descriptors. Unfortunately, the thread didn’t survive and ideas
were lost&hellip; (by the way, it is funny that this kind of problem
resuscitated in CVE-2012-0056 lately&hellip;)</li>
<li>As one goes along, <code>execve()</code> became almost magical, it had to
support Set-User-Id, capabilities, and file capabilities. Each
feature added complexity and different legacy behaviors to maintain.
Instead of dropping these POSIX features, OpenWall 3.0 took a
different approach by removing Suid binaries from its base install,
thus preventing execve’s voodoo. This change is just a line in Owl’s
changelog but is in fact a major achievement: it required them to
re-architecture important softwares like crontab or <a href="http://www.openwall.com/tcb/">user management
tools</a>.<br />
<code>/bin/ping</code> is setuid-root because it opens a raw socket and injects
its packet on the wire directly. <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commit;h=c319b4d76b9e583a5d88d6bf190e079c4e43213d">A new socket type, <code>PROT_ICMP</code>,
was developed by Openwall
team,</a>
it makes possible to send ICMP Echo messages without special
privileges (caller’s GID has to be included in a range stored in a
sysctl key). It is interesting to note that only replies (based on
ICMP identifier field) are sent to userspace, not the whole ICMP
traffic like in Mac OS X.</li>
<li><a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commit;h=6e5714eaf77d79ae1c8b47e3e040ff5411b717ec">TCP Initial Sequence number is now a 32-bits random number using
MD5</a>.
ISN was previously the concatenation of 24 random bits (MD4 of TCP
end points with a secret rekeyed every 5 minutes) and an 8 bits
counter (number of times secret key was regenerated)</li>
<li>Vasilily tried to push upstream <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cross-arch/10430">additional checks for
<code>copy_{to,from}_user()</code></a>
(by checking if requested size fits boundaries fixed at compile
time), this patch was a cut down version of <code>PAX_USERCOPY</code> but was
NACKed by Linus asking him for more “balance and sanity”. However,
he didn’t reject the idea itself, saying that a cleaner version
might be accepted&hellip;</li>
