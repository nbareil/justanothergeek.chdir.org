# Rear pannier

I use an [Ortlieb Vario QL3.1](https://www.ortlieb.com/en_us/back-roller-high-visibility-ql31+F5500) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231008085251/https://www.ortlieb.com/en_us/back-roller-high-visibility-ql31+F5500)) that I am loving:
- It is waterproof: I never had any water infiltration despite harsh conditions.
- The Quick-Lock 3.1 mechanism works unbelievably well: Once clipped in, nothing moves (no clunky noise when you ride) and you are guaranteed it won't fall. Bonus: You can operate it with a single hand, very practical! I love this bag.
- There is also the accessory to transform it into a backpack but to be honest, I never used this feature in the last 3 years.
- Indestructible: It has no mark of tear despite many years of rough usage.
- Just one note: Do not put anything in the side pockets, they will eventually be ejected from the pocket while riding, I lost a pair of sunglasses that way :(

# What's in my bag?

![Content of my bag](/images/bike_bag_content.jpeg)

No matter the weather conditions, I always carry the following items in my bag:

1. My Sunglasses, either [photochromic sunglasses 0-3](https://www.amazon.com/Julbo-Aerospeed-Performance-Sunglasses-Spectron/dp/B0794HXNHQ) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231008084836/https://www.amazon.com/Julbo-Aerospeed-Performance-Sunglasses-Spectron/dp/B0794HXNHQ)) during winter or [large and very tinted ones](https://www.oakley.com/en-us/product/W0OO9401) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231008084852/https://www.oakley.com/en-us/product/W0OO9401)) when the sun shines.
2. All [my raining clothes](#raining-clothes) go into this fabric bag (protip: do not use plastic bag 
   to hold your stuff, first they will break quickly, and more importantly, your
   clothes will eventually smell very bad)
3. Backup Inner tube, correctly packed :)
4. My field toolbox holding everything to repair my bike. Everything is stored in this nice [Camelback Organizer](https://www.probikeshop.fr/trousse-a-outils-camelbak-organizer-jaune-2-aa7/129612.html) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231008084545/https://www.probikeshop.fr/trousse-a-outils-camelbak-organizer-jaune-2-aa7/129612.html)). 

5.  Mini-pump, this one was actually replaced by a [Silica Gravelero mini-pump](https://silca.cc/products/gravelero-mini-pump) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231008081151/https://silcavelo.eu/products/gravelero-mini-pump)). This new one is much more practical thanks to its expanding hose (I kept destroying valves before) and have a bigger volume of air.

## Toolbox

![Content of my toolbox](/images/bike_toolbox.jpeg)

1. Plastic gloves! Because who likes to have grease or dirt on your hand after repairing your bike on the field? It weights nothing, why not be a little bit comfortable?
2. CO<sub>2</sub> inflator and cartridge to very quickly inflate your tire.
3. Set of pliers: I know you can unseat a tire without those, but why make it the hard way?
4. My multitool, a [Crankbrothers F15](https://www.crankbrothers.com/products/f15) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231008083000/https://www.crankbrothers.com/products/f15))
5. It may look weird, but this is a blade of scalpel. I use this toolbox for my commuting ride but also for my mountain bike trips. Who knows what can happens in the middle of nowhere? Anyway, I am sure I will be happy to have a very sharp blade (if you have already seen the "[127 hours movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1542344/)", you will understand my point).
6. A quick link (SRAM PowerLocks), in case my chain breaks.
7. Inner Tube Repairing Kit (patches, scratch, glue) for the desperate situations (as I don't trust this reparation at all)
8. My Swiss knife (with all its lames sharpen as hell, see previous point 5️⃣)
9. [Camelback Organizer](https://www.probikeshop.fr/trousse-a-outils-camelbak-organizer-jaune-2-aa7/129612.html) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231008084545/https://www.probikeshop.fr/trousse-a-outils-camelbak-organizer-jaune-2-aa7/129612.html))
10. Cable Zip ties enclosed in a plastic bag because they will always find a way to escape from the bag's mesh otherwise. Zip ties is the absolute tool to fix anything on your bike.

    There is also a small piece of soap to lubricate the tire when changing a tube (protip!).
