## My default outfit

Where I live, Toulouse, France :fr:, the Autumn season is synonym with chilled temperatures in the morning (6¬∞C to 10¬∞C), and warm after-noon (18¬∞C to 22¬∞C), it often means that I am wearing different clothes for the back and forth trips.

My rule is simple: I am keeping the short until the temperature is above 8¬∞C, that's my limit of comfort. Your mileage may vary.

Usually, my default outfit will look like this:

1. Long sleeve insulated jacket: [Rapha's "*Men's Pro Team Winter Jacket*"](https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/mens-pro-team-winter-jacket/product/PJW02XXSLAXLG) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007180452/https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/mens-pro-team-winter-jacket/product/PJW02XXSLAXLG)): It is a nice jacket because it is warm without being a windbreaker, your body can breathe like a charm: I actually like the bit of cold air flowing through the fabric, I hate being sweaty.
2. Bib Short
3. Short, such as [Rapha's Trail Lightweight shorts](https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/mens-trail-lightweight-shorts/product/AWI01XXSES) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231008093946/https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/mens-trail-lightweight-shorts/product/AWI01XXSES)), which is excellent for mountain biking!
4. [Assos Spring Fall gloves](https://www.assos.com/us/spring-fall-gloves-evo-187543.html) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007180207/https://www.assos.com/us/spring-fall-gloves-evo-187543.html))

## Cold morning

1. A Merino base layer such as [Icebreaker's "*Oasis 200*"](https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/mens-baselayers/merino-200-oasis-long-sleeve-crewe-thermal-top/104365U2.html?dwvar_104365U2_color=853&dwvar_104365U2_US=in_line) or [Rapha's equivalent](https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/mens-merino-base-layer-long-sleeve/product/BLS02LSBLK) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007180216/https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/mens-merino-base-layer-long-sleeve/product/BLS02LSBLK))
2. [A very thin Merino beanie](https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/hats-neckwear/merino-chase-beanie/100746U2.html?dwvar_100746U2_color=010&dwvar_100746U2_US=in_line) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007180238/https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/hats-neckwear/merino-chase-beanie/100746U2.html?dwvar_100746U2_color=010&dwvar_100746U2_US=in_line)), it doesn't protect my ears, it is just to not have too much loss of warmness from my head.
3. Long sleeve insulated jacket: [Rapha's "*Men's Pro Team Winter Jacket*"](https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/mens-pro-team-winter-jacket/product/PJW02XXSLAXLG) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007180452/https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/mens-pro-team-winter-jacket/product/PJW02XXSLAXLG)): It is a nice jacket because it is warm without being a windbreaker, your body can breathe like a charm: I actually like the bit of cold air flowing through the fabric, I hate being sweaty.
4. Classic Tights
5. [Assos Spring Fall gloves](https://www.assos.com/us/spring-fall-gloves-evo-187543.html) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007180207/https://www.assos.com/us/spring-fall-gloves-evo-187543.html))
