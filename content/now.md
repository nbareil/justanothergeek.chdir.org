title: What am I doing these days?

The `/now` idea comes from [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about), he summarized it as:

> Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.

As of **May 2024**:

### Work

- I am currently in the process of switching job, moving from a Corporate role to an Incident Response Consulting gig.

### Computer stuff

- Alternating Zed, vim and VSCode.
- Nix is the future: My whole setup is based on a mixture home-manager and the spreading of `default.nix` and `flake.nix` into each project I am touching.
- I still don't manage to be interested by Rust despite having the greatest minds trying to convince me: As I am not doing very low level programming, I don't see clearly its benefits. I still prefer Golang for its simplicity.
