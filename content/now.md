title: What am I doing these days?

The `/now` idea comes from [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about), he summarized it as:

> Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.

As of **February 2025**:

### Work

- I am now a consultant in Incident Response, I am exposed to many many attacks, technologies, and threat actors. I am never bored :)

### Computer stuff

- I am using Zed, and vim.
- Nix is the future and my present: My whole setup is based on a mixture home-manager and the spreading of `default.nix` and `flake.nix` into each project I am touching.
- I still don't manage to be interested by Rust despite having the greatest minds trying to convince me: As I am not doing very low level programming, I don't see clearly its benefits. I still prefer Golang for its simplicity.

### Away from keyboard

- I am now doing Crossfit 4 times per week. I suck at it but I like the learning of new skills.
- I stopped Zwift-ing and I bought a [Concept 2 BikeERG](https://www.concept2.com/ergs/bikeerg) (second hand) instead, I love its simplicity and its smoothness.
- Still cycling, I tried the Gravel pill but it did not click on me so I am on the edge of buying a new Mountain Bike just to get SRAM AXS ;)
