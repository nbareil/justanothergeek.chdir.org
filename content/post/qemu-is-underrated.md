title: "QEMU is so underrated"

Using an Apple Silicon laptop, dealing with malware analysis is always a challenge. While Windows ARM does a decent job emulating x86, there’s always the concern that the artifacts you observe may not behave the same way on a real x86 architecture. The only reliable solution is to use **QEMU**—despite being a fully emulated CPU, it performs exceptionally well. On top of that, you will also find an amazing community sharing their [anti-detection patches](https://github.com/zhaodice/qemu-anti-detection).

As I rediscover **QEMU**, I’m convinced it’s one of the finest pieces of software ever developed. Every time I read its documentation, I uncover incredible new features. For example, lately, I learned about the ["Virtual FAT Disk Image" option](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html#virtual-fat-disk-images), which serves as an equivalent to the Shared Folder feature in VMware and VirtualBox.
