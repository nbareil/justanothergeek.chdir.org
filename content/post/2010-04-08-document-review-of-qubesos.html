<div class='post'>
<h2>Qubes OS</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2010/04/introducing-qubes-os.html">You</a> <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/04/07/1754208/Researcher-Releases-Hardened-OS-Qubes-Xen-Hits-40?">must have</a> <a href="http://linuxfr.org/2010/04/07/26705.html">heard</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/alexsotirov/statuses/11796459373">about</a> it, <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/">Invisible Things Lab</a> released their
own operating system, named <a href="http://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes OS</a> (If you ask me, I would have refer to it as a
Linux distribution instead). Their distribution focuses on security isolation
and is based on their virtualization experience (for the record,
Joanna and Rafal are the people behind most of the virtualization
vulnerabilities found in the previous years).

<p><b>Disclaimer</b>: I do not had the occasion to test the system, this post
is only based on my reading of their (great)
<a href="http://www.qubes-os.org/files/doc/arch-spec-0.3.pdf">QubesOs architecture paper</a> (version 0.3). I did not read the source code or
whatever so be careful with what is following :)
</p>

<h3>Target of the distribution</h3>


<p>
Maybe I am guessing wrong, but this distribution seems to be really
dedicated for classified environments. Even if it is usable by
anyone, some concepts make me believe this work will be sold to
government or military people because it full-fills most of the
requirements. Anyway, this is awesome to release it to the public,
in an Open Source licence.
</p>
<p>
I am sure that this release will be really helpful for the people
involved in "<a href="http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/site_article91.html">SEC&amp;SI challenge</a>" organized by the french
government. This research project is dedicated to the construction
of a secure Desktop platform (Linux based) usable by my grandma.
</p>

<h3>What is new?</h3>


<p>
There is nothing new by itself: only components already available in
the community have been used (Linux kernel, Xen, Xorg, LUKS, device
mapper, etc.), few code have been developed.
</p>
<p>
The beauty of their solution is that every techniques used are
individually known but nobody had the idea to put them together like
they did. Bravo!
</p>

<h3>The big picture</h3>


<p>
User activities can be identified in multiple security levels: web
browsing, banking, corporate work, social networking, e-shopping,
etc.
</p>
<p>
Each activity represents a security domain: banking activities are
more critical than social networking (right?). Usually, on most of
operating systems, every activities are in the same "space": if you
are compromised while browsing <a href="#sec-1.3">youtube.com</a>, the attacker can access
to your sensitive data (bank account or corporate email).
</p>
<p>
So QubesOS resolves this problem by running each domain into a virtual
machine (called <i>AppVM</i> in QubesOS terminology), the virtualization
solution they chose is Xen. They explain why they chose Xen instead
of KVM in their architecture guide.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the Xen hypervisor, each AppVM is isolated and cannot have
access to other ressources than its own.
</p>


<h3>Architecture</h3>
<h4>Multimedia</h4>

<ul>
<li>Display <br/>

<p>
Until Qubes OS, every Linux distribution providing "multi level
security" use one X server running on the Host (in Dom0) and each
virtual machine uses the display thanks to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
VNC-over-ssh. Problem: VNC client and server have not really been
audited and they are crippled of security issues.

</li>
<li>
X11 forwarding. Problem: There is basically no security control in
X11, a X client can do anything on other windows like capturing or
injecting keystrokes, snooping other applications, etc. This is
problematic when windows do not have the same security level.

</li>
</ul>

<p>A lesser used alternative is the use of one Xorg server per virtual
machine: each security level is inside a virtual terminal. However,
unless there is a video card per X session, every servers share the
same hardware resource so a vulnerability in Xorg would impact other
Xorg servers.
</p>
<p>
The innovation of Qubes OS is to not use any of theses methods. Each
AppVM runs a Xorg instance (with a "dummy graphic driver", which I
guess is not tied to any hardware device) and a <i>AppVM Window Manager</i>.
</p>
<p>
The dom0 domain runs the "real" Xorg server tied to the graphic card
and multiple <i>AppViewers</i>, each <i>AppViewer</i> communicates with one
<i>AppVM Window Manager</i> (which is inside a <i>AppVM</i>) via the Xen Ring
buffer protocol. The task of each <i>AppViewer</i> is to proxify input
devices to the right <i>AppVM</i> (depending on who has the focus). Each
virtual machine uses a homemade input xorg-driver called
<code>xf86-input-mfndev</code> (which gets its input from the ring buffer).
</p>
<p>
Each <i>AppVM Window Manager</i> sends notifications to its associated
<i>AppViewer</i>. The events monitored are: creation of new window,
content refresh or change of window focus.
</p>
<p>
When an <i>AppViewer</i> receives a <i>content refresh</i> notification, it
requests to the <i>AppVM Window Manager</i> its <i>composition buffer</i> (the
bitmap of the window content in other words). It receives theses
bytes from the ring buffer and displays it on the screen.
</p>
<p>
The optimization, which is still being investigate, is to ask the
address of the composition buffer instead of the sending the raw
bitmap. This is possible because the dom0 has access to the address
space of every <i>AppVM</i> so it can directly use the bytes to render it
without involving a double-copy.
</p>
<p>
However, I do not know if this optimization would be sufficient to
handle video playback: the paper suggests that the user can watch
video on youtube so it seems to work, but I don't see how. Even on
my "normal" desktop, the system goes slow if I simply disable Xvideo
overlay.
</p>
</li>
<li>Audio <br/>

<p>
Audio support is not yet implemented but will be certainly based on the
same principle than the "composition buffer": audio stream will be
"written" in a buffer readable by <i>AppViewer</i>.
</p>
<p>
That way, a dom0 daemon just has to mix every <i>AppViewer</i> audio
streams and eventually sends the final stream to the sound card.
</p>
</li>
<li>Clipboard <br/>

<p>
"Applicative clipboard" (in opposition to X11 clipboard mechanism)
operations are supported between <i>AppVM</i>. The user has to press a
special shortcut (S-C-v) which is intercepted by the dom0 and not
passed to <i>AppVM</i>. At this point, the <i>AppViewer</i> triggers a command
on the virtual machine, sending the content of the cursor selection
through the Xen ring buffer. The bytes are then stored in a volatile
file on dom0.
</p>
<p>
When the special <i>paste shortcut</i> is pressed, the dom0 injects the
stored result via the ring buffer again and emulates the paste
action.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storage architecture </h4>



<p>
<i>AppsVMs</i> share the same "base filesystem" in order to not waste
disk space. For that matter, each domain mounts a read-only block
device and mounts, on top of it, a copy-on-write block device
(thanks to the kernel's device-mapper) accessible only to the
<i>AppVM</i>.
</p>
<p>
Each time an <i>AppVM</i> is started, the copy-on-write volume is deleted
in order to have a clean environment. Persistent data (like user
documents) are stored in another private volume which is restored at
<i>AppVM</i> creation time.
</p>
<p>
Every block devices are exported by the <i>Storage Domain</i>. This
abstraction layer is needed to make possible file-sharing between
<i>AppVMs</i> (thanks to a homemade cryptographic protocol).
</p>
<p>
We can see that the <i>Storage Domain</i> has great powers. To
counterbalance it, cryptography was used.
</p>
<p>
The "base read-only block device" is signed (on a per-block
basis). The private key is available only to the TPM and the dom0.
</p>
<p>
Application specific volumes (the copy-on-write overlay and the
persistent block device) are encrypted (with LUKS) with a key
available only to <i>AppVMs</i> and the dom0.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to this design, a compromission of the <i>Storage Domain</i> would
be worthless because any attempt to modify data would be
detected and persistent files are encrypted so an attacker would be
disappointed :)
</p>

<h4>Network architecture </h4>


<p>
Most of the remote vulnerabilities found in the Linux kernel have
been discovered in device drivers like network adapters. Because any
bug found in the kernel puts in danger the whole system, it would be
great to find a way to isolate theses drivers.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to recent CPU features, it is now possible to do such
thing: Intel VT-d technology permits to safely give to a virtual
machine access to a hardware device.
</p>
<p>
In other words, QubesOS now delegates the PCI wireless card to an
<i>AppVM</i>, called <i>Network domain</i>. At this point, if a vulnerability
is found in the wifi driver, only the virtual machine is
compromised.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Network domain</i> is the border router: every <i>AppVM</i> routes its
traffic through it. One of its task is also to enforce traffic
policy: <i>AppVMs</i> are not allowed to communicate between each other,
only HTTPS flows are allowed for the banking domain, only VPN
traffic is allowed for corporate domain, etc.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>


<p>
On the paper, Qubes OS seems really well designed and robust from a
security point of view. By glancing at the screenshots, the user
experience seems good. I don't know how good/bad are the
performances: memory usage must be really high (because AFAIK, Xen
does not implement the "<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/31003">Kernel Samepage Merging</a>" feature available
in KVM since 2.6.32).
</p>
<p>
But, anyway, congratulations to "Invisible Things Lab" for this
great architecture!
