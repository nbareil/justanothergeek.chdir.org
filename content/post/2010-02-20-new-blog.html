title: New blog, new rules
---

<div class='post'>
Sometimes, I receive emails asking me to translate my papers or blog posts in English; 
each time, I procrastinate and never do it. My year's resolution is to address this issue, that's why this blog goes  english now.<br />
<br />
Off course, I will not translate previous posts because it would be so time-consumming that even just identify which post is interesting enough to be translated would be too long.<br />
<br />
That's why I will keep available my previous posts at this address: <a href="http://chdir.org/%7Enico/blog/posts/">http://chdir.org/~nico/blog/posts/</a> and also because there are indexed by search engines.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;That is also the occasion of using a modern blogging engine like before my switch to ikiwiki, so I use the Blogspot services from now on:<br />
<ul>
<li>Atom and RSS feeds are both  redirected to the blogspot Atom feed (yeah that sucks for RSS-only reader) </li>
<li><a href="http://chdir.org/%7Enico/blog/">http://chdir.org/~nico/blog/</a> redirects to <a href="http://justanothergeek.chdir.org/%20">justanothergeek.chdir.org</a></li>
</ul>
Now that comments are back, feel free to nitpick :) <br />
<br />
<ul>
</ul></div>
