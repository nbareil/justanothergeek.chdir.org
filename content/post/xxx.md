This blog has been powered by a few engines since its beginning ([17 years ago!](http://web.archive.org/web/20070630005537/http://mouarf.org:80/blog/)), it was first powered by a PHP engine called [Dotclear](https://dotclear.org) [started in 2003](http://web.archive.org/web/20070630005537/http://mouarf.org:80/blog/).

Nobody likes operating a PHP website but at that time, a French ISP, Free, was offering free PHP hosting so I did not had to care about its security or anything. I had to change my mind when I moved to a self-hosting solution, this quickly led me to a static website generated by Jekyll. I won't go into all the pros and cons of static websites, as Dane already wrote about it on his blog: [Deploying a Static Website via Azure](https://blog.dane.io/2019/12/28/deploying-a-static-website-via-azure.html).
