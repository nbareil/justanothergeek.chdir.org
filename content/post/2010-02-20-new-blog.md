title: New blog, new rules
---

Sometimes, I receive emails asking me to translate my papers or blog
posts in English; each time, I procrastinate and never do it. My year's
resolution is to address this issue, that's why this blog goes english
now.\
\
Off course, I will not translate previous posts because it would be so
time-consumming that even just identify which post is interesting enough
to be translated would be too long.\
\
That's why I will keep available my previous posts at this address:
[http://chdir.org/\~nico/blog/posts/](http://chdir.org/%7Enico/blog/posts/)
and also because there are indexed by search engines.\
\
Â That is also the occasion of using a modern blogging engine like before
my switch to ikiwiki, so I use the Blogspot services from now on:\
-   Atom and RSS feeds are both redirected to the blogspot Atom feed
    (yeah that sucks for RSS-only reader)
-   [http://chdir.org/\~nico/blog/](http://chdir.org/%7Enico/blog/)
    redirects to
    [justanothergeek.chdir.org](http://justanothergeek.chdir.org/%20)

Now that comments are back, feel free to nitpick :)\
